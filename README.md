# eight-puzzle
Project simulates solving a well-known puzzle of eight. It makes you enter 9 numbers, grid by 3x3, where 9 indicates an empty box. solving means arrange numbers so that it increases (from top-left to bottom-right). Program first checks if puzzle is solvable and if so it runs DFS on grid. There is opportunity to run algorithm which adds new state in queue informly not randomly. At the end program prints the number of states from start to goal, and time it needed to solve the puzzle.
